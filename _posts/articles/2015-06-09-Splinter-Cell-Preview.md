Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory Preview
Many of you already know Sam Fisher is heading to consoles next year. Well, he's also hitting N-Gage!

What's Hot:

If you've been craving a spy adventure on your N-Gage, Nokia and developer Gameloft are set to thrill you with Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory. Retaining many of the features found in the game's console counterpart, this fully 3D stealth-based title throws you into the role of Sam Fisher, who's out to stop the threat of information warfare. Sneak unseen into numerous deadly locations and pick off enemies from the shadows using Fisher's high tech weaponry. Hang off poles, get a bird's eye view with sticky cams, or creep up behind a guard and slit his throat! The game features a slick graphics engine capable of dynamic lighting as well as Fisher's cool infrared goggle effects. Releasing in 2005, Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory will stand out as a member of the N-Gage's finest titles.


In-Depth Preview:

The last time we saw Sam Fisher on the N-Gage, he was saving the world and killing enemy guards in a 2D side-scrolling game that, while okay, wasn't exactly as good as his Xbox adventures. Seeing as how the N-Gage has limitations, I expected Nokia to handle Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory the same exact way, but developer Gameloft has done nothing of the sort. Rather, the sequel to one of the N-Gage's best games has made the jump to full 3D, and it may very be one of the system's killer apps.

Chaos Theory takes place in 2008, where information warfare is a chief concern of the free world, so Sam Fisher is sent to thwart the plans of Earth's evilest minds. His adventure, unlike the previous games, will take you to more exotic locales including Japan and Korea, so the game's definitely got a fresh look to it, something that the developers have perfectly captured on the N-Gage. Basically, Nokia's port of the upcoming console game is exactly that. It's a near mirror image of the game we'll be playing on Xbox next year. While not as gorgeous, it still holds its own, and the 3D engine is capable of some amazing things, chief among them, silky smooth gameplay.

If you're revolting in horror at the thought of N-Gage 3D, don't worry because the game basically looks like a PSOne game running in high-res, which is quite an impressive feat for the platform. Gameloft's managed to toss in numerous effects including dynamic lighting and the ability to see things through Sam's infrared goggles. It's truly a sight to behold, and I'm hoping that this will usher in a new wave of quality 3D titles on Nokia's system.

As for the gameplay, I was pleased to see that Fisher has many of his most famous maneuvers and equipment. He can take out the enemy with his pistol or rifle, and he can still sneak up behind enemies and grab them, whereupon which you'll have the option of using them as human shields or just slitting their throats. The cutting animation as he zips his blade along their flesh is well done, and by and large the rest of his moves are also well executed. You can creep along walls, dump bodies in the shadows, and hang off poles. While on a pole, you can kill enemies in one of two ways, both of which involve your pistol. Either you hang from one arm and pick them off, or, if you want to be fancy, you can hang upside down and pop them in the head. In addition to all of that stuff, Fisher can also break down doors. It's a very useful feature because if there's a guard on the other side, doing this results in a quick knock out. Of course, if you'd rather be a tad bit sneakier, you can settle for lock picking.

The single-player game is going to keep you busy for quite a while, as Nokia informed me that the N-Gage version of Chaos Theory is just as big as the console version, but in addition to the campaign there are also multiplayer options to keep you busy. The game will feature a Spies Vs Spies mode and co-op play. Lastly, for those of you who love to brag about high scores, you'll be able to upload them while connected to the N-Gage Arena.

Our meeting was running long so I didn't get to actually play Chaos Theory, but from what Nokia showed me I'm very much anticipating this game. It has most if not all of the console version's features and it looks amazing, so if you're looking for a showpiece for your N-Gage system, definitely pick up Splinter Cell Chaos Theory when it releases alongside the Xbox version in March, 2005.
